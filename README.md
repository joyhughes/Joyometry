Uses the CGAL open-source computational geometry library

Implemented the following functionality 
- Load .off geometry file
- Measure wall thickness of model
- Uniform scaling of model
- Fill holes in model
- Export to .off and .stl geometry files

This image shows results - areas with wall thickness below a given threshold are colored red.
